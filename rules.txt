==QWIXX RULES==

-Numbers must be crossed out from left to right in each of the four coloured rows.
-They do not have to be crossed out sequentially, however once you choose a number in
the row to cross out, you can't go back and cross out number before it in the row.

-The computer will roll the dice, then:
  -All players may cross out the sum of the two white dice from any one of their coloured rows.
  -Players do not have to cross out a number if they do not want to.
  -The active player then adds the sum of one white dice and any one of the coloured dice.
  -The active player (only) may then cross out that number on the same row as the coloured dice chosen.
  -The active player does not have to cross out this number if they do not want to.

-If after both actions on the turn, the active player has not crossed out at least one number, they gain one
penalty point, which reduces their score at the end of the game.

-Locking a row:
  -A player can lock a row (removing the dice from play) if they have:
    -Crossed out at least five numbers in the row
    -AND have crossed out the furthest to the right number.

-Ending a game:
  -The computer will end the game if:
    -One player has received four penalty points
    -OR if two of the dice have been removed from play.
  -The computer will then add up the scores and decide the winner.
